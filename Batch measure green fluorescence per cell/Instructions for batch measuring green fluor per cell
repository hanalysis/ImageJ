To use this macro you need to have one folder location where all images you want to process are. Please do not store anything 
else to this location. Once this macro has been run, your results will save to an excel file in this location. 

To measure fluorescence, the macro creates a binary "mask" based on a fluorescence threshold that you will need to set. When 
running the macro, you will be asked to input the minimum and maximum threshold values into a dialogue box, so you need to 
know these beforehand. To determine what the minimum and maximum values are, go to image -> colour -> split channels, then select
the green channel, then adjust -> threshold. Once you have chosen your threshold values, you can close the image and run the
macro. The same threshold values will be used across all images processed in this batch. 

You will also need to input a minimum size threshold for your particles. For more information on setting these thresholds, 
see: https://imagej.net/imaging/particle-analysis.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Q) Why am I not getting a mean fluorescence value?
A) Go to Analyze -> Set measurements, and make sure you have "Area", "Mean gray value", "Min & max gray value" and "Limit to threshold" selected.

Q) Why do I have an error relating to create mask?
A) This could be for several reasons. Make sure that
  1. All your images have green fluorescent channels in them.
  2. All images saved in your folder are correctly formatted tifs
  3. There are *only* images in your folder - .csv files or .txt files will crash the macro
  4. That you have selected a file path which directs you to the correct folder and not a file within the folder.

If all of these are OK and you are still receiving errors, please get in touch.
